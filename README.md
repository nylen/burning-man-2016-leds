### What?

LED strips for an art project at Burning Man 2016 (Vapor Cannon Guild from
Birmingham, AL).

6 Arduino Uno controllers each running a timed sequence on 2 strips of WS2812
LEDs, synchronized via a "drift" factor stored in the EEPROM of each
controller.  A real-time clock would be better.

4 light patterns:

- "Snakes" - randomly colored lines that start at one end and move to the other
- "Sky" - slowly shifting between blue, white, green, and occasionally orange
- "Sparkles" - rainbow-colored dots that "explode" in a small burst of white
- "Rainbow" - shifting rainbow effects with varying hue and brightness
